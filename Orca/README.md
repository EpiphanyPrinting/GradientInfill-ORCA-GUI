# Gradientinfill for Orca slicer:
## Importatnt note:
**This version isn't running properly. Running the script directly from the slicer doesn't work yet. You can run the script from an IDE.**

The script changes the gcode succesfully. However i couldn't visualize the changes made inside of any gcode previwer. The only way to tell a difference is to compare both files inside of the notepad++ with the compare plugin.

Please read the README.md of the [Prusa folder](https://github.com/WatchingWatches/GradientInfill/tree/master/Prusa). All of the requirements for the slicer settings are the same. I recommend using the prusa script instead of this one.

There will be a detailed guide for this script simular to the prusa one, when this script is running properly.
